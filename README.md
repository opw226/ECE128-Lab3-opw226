The goal for this lab is to be able to design an adder that has three inputs A, B, a carry in and two outputs of the sum and a carry out. This will be achieved by creating a one-bit full adder, that will then be utilized in both a 2-bit full ripple carry adder and a 2-bit full carry lookahead adder. These adders will then need to be connected the the seven-segment LED display in order to display the inputs and outputs. A test bench will also be needed in order to display the different potential outputs for each of the adders. It is important to be able to have the proper pin assignments and be able to edit the constraints file correctly.
